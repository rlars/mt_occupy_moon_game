To operate, an arrayed solar generator must be at elevation +1 or above and have a transparent block (air or vacuum) immediately above it. It will generate power only when the block above is well lit during daylight hours. It will generate more power at higher elevation, reaching maximum output at elevation +36 or higher when sunlit.
