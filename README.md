## Warning
Development is far from finished, but you should be able to have a good time for a few hours!

## How to play
Before starting a world, enable your favorite inventory with 3d_armor support! Only then you can wear your spacesuit!
### Get started
You start with a landing site marker for a supply rocket.
Place it on a free spot, step back and wait for max. 30 seconds for the rocket to arrive.
Apart from other things, you will find a **Chemicals Sampler** which you will need to unlock more supplies.
Your task is to show that you can produce food and resources on the moon!
- Build a sealed greenhouse.
- Release the air inside.
- Get some moon stone, turn it into gravel.
- Get some moon dust and take some wheat from your supplies.
- Make soil from these three ingredients! Don´t place it outside, though...
- Find some ice as water source.
- Plant your first crops!

### Another word of warning
You better don´t extend your greenhouse from within, build a second or a third one. The vacuum mod might ruin you otherwise...

### Get more supplies
Those guys on earth want you to first provide **12 wheat**. Stuff it into the Chemicals Sampler and expect some supplies in exchange.
Next, is to show that you can expand. Insert **20 dirt** and **2 white wool** for the next supplies.
